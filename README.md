# Homework Tracker

This app will allow users to create a profile, and log in. When users are logged in, they will be able to add new homework assignments with associated due dates and to-do lists. The home page will display all upcoming assignments and show whether they are complete or incomplete. Users will also have the option to add additional assignments. When adding an assignment, choose the date and time that the assignment is due. When the user clicks on a specific assignment, they will see a to-do list, with options to add tasks, delete tasks, or mark them complete.

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

USER STORY:

AS A student
I WANT to log in and manage my upcoming homework assignments
SO THAT I can complete homework on time.

## Stretch Goals

- Add a page for "Completed" homework assignments, or pin them to the bottom of the homepage.
- For a more user friendly page, update the homepage to display a calendar with the current month and year. Allow user to add a new homework assignment by calendar day.
- Add an "Alert" function to inform users of homework assignments that are due soon.
- Currently, when we add a task to a homework assignment, it collapses the homework assignment - fix to keep display open.
